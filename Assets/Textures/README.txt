Due to legal requirements, I can't include the textures I use in the this repo.
The textures used were free at the time of creation and I will provide links to where they were sourced.

To make this work best with the meta file system Unity uses, I'm going to leave a text file in each folder listing all the assets required for that folder.
I will not change any of the default file names so all you need to do is download the files, place them in their respected folders and everything should work out.
